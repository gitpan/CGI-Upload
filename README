NAME
    CGI::Upload - CGI class for handling browser file uploads

SYNOPSIS
     use CGI::Upload;

     my $upload = CGI::Upload->new;

     my $file_name = $upload->file_name('field');
     my $file_type = $upload->file_type('field');

     $upload->mime_magic('/path/to/mime.types');
     my $mime_type = $upload->mime_type('field');

     my $file_handle = $upload->file_handle('field');

DESCRIPTION
    This module has been written to provide a simple and secure manner by
    which to handle files uploaded in multipart/form-data requests through a
    web browser. The primary advantage which this module offers over
    existing modules is the single interface which it provides for the most
    often required information regarding files uploaded in this manner.

    This module builds upon primarily the CGI and File::MMagic modules and
    offers some tidy and succinct methods for the handling of files uploaded
    via multipart/form-data requests.

METHODS
    The following methods are available through this module for use in CGI
    scripts and can be exported into the calling namespace upon request.

    new This object constructor method creates and returns a new CGI::Upload
        object. In previously versions of CGI::Upload, a mandatory argument
        of the CGI object to be used was required. This is no longer
        necessary due to the singleton nature of CGI objects.

    query
        Returns the CGI object used within the CGI::Upload class.

    file_handle('field')
        This method returns the file handle to the temporary file containing
        the file uploaded through the form input field named 'field'. This
        temporary file is generated using the new_tmpfile method of IO::File
        and is anonymous in nature, where possible.

    file_name('field')
        This method returns the file name of the file uploaded through the
        form input field named 'field' - This file name does not reflect the
        local temporary filename of the uploaded file, but that for the file
        supplied by the client web browser.

    file_type('field')
        This method returns the file type of the file uploaded as specified
        by the filename extension - Please note that this does not
        necessarily reflect the nature of the file uploaded, but allows CGI
        scripts to perform cursory validation of the file type of the
        uploaded file.

    mime_magic('/path/to/mime.types')
        This method sets and/or returns the external magic mime types file
        to be used for the identification of files via the mime_type method.
        By default, MIME identification is based upon internal mime types
        defined within the File::MMagic module.

        See the File::MMagic manpage for further details.

    mime_type('field')
        This method returns the MIME type of the file uploaded through the
        form input field named 'field' as determined by file magic numbers.
        This is the best means by which to validate the nature of the
        uploaded file.

        See the File::MMagic manpage for further details.
