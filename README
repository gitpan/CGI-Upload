NAME
    CGI::Upload - CGI class for handling browser file uploads

SYNOPSIS
      use CGI;
      use CGI::Upload;

      my $cgi = CGI->new;
      my $upload = CGI::Upload->new( $cgi );

      my $file_name = $upload->file_name( 'field_name' );
      my $file_type = $upload->file_type( 'field_name' );

      $upload->mime_magic( '/path/to/mime.types' );
      my $mime_type = $upload->mime_type( 'field_name' );

      my $file_handle = $upload->file_handle( 'field_name' );

DESCRIPTION
    This module has been written to provide a simple and secure
    manner by which to handle files uploaded in multipart/form-data
    requests through a web browser. The primary advantage which this
    module offers over existing modules is the single interface
    providing the most often required information regarding files
    uploaded through multipart/form-data requests.

    Building on the CGI manpage and the File::MMagic manpage, this
    module offers a very tidy and succinct interface for handling of
    file uploads.

METHODS
    The following methods are available through this module for use
    in CGI scripts and can be exported upon request.

    new( $cgi )
        This method creates and returns a new CGI::Upload object,
        the only mandatory argument to which is a CGI.pm object.
        This is in part because only a single CGI.pm object can be
        initiated within a given CGI script.

    file_handle( 'field_name' )
        This method returns the file handle to a temporary file
        containing the file uploaded through the form input field
        named 'field_name'.

    file_name( 'field_name' )
        This method returns the file name of the file uploaded
        through the form input field named 'field_name' - This file
        name does not reflect the local temporary file name of the
        uploaded file, but that supplied by the client web browser.

    file_type( 'field_name' )
        This method returns the file type of the file uploaded as
        indicated by the file extension - This does not necessarily
        reflect the nature of the file uploaded, but allows CGI
        scripts to perform cursory validation on the file uploaded.

    mime_magic( '/path/to/mime.types' )
        This method sets and/or returns the external magic mime
        types file to be used for identification of files via the
        mime_type method. By default, identification is based upon
        internal mime types defined within the File::MMagic module.

        See the File::MMagic manpage for further details.

    mime_type( 'field_name' )
        This method returns the file type of the file uploaded
        through the form input field named 'field_name' as indicated
        by the file magic numbers. This is the best means by which
        to validate the nature of the uploaded file.

        See the File::MMagic manpage for further details.
